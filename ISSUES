* Need a good way of finding the 'status' window to attach new connections to;
  also, a way to go from tags to the windows listening to them
* Investigate terminal input edge cases
  = Malformed UTF8 - we might hang
  = Escape sequences that are unknown may result in later ones being lost eg:
    ^[[, followed by left arrow sequence would consume all of ^[[^[[D
  = Can the UTF8 grouping be moved into lua?
* Investigate using SQLite or BDB for buffer contents.
