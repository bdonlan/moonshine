This document is sort of a history of design decisions, more than a formal
design document.


Why I am not using C++ and Swig
-------------------------------

I considered using C++ and Swig, especially for the UI widgets that bd_ wrote.
Rewriting the code to be valid C++ is not hard, so I did that.
However, while swig is really good at wrapping code, wrapping code that uses
function pointers is difficult. It requires complicated type maps and I did not
feel like doing that. So I am not going to use C++ or swig.


Why I am not using coroutines
-----------------------------

Coroutines would greatly simplify things. I could pretend that net.connect() and
friends block. However, it seems non-trivial to use coroutines as I want to.

However, I will continue using coroutines in the future, especially if someone
else does it.
A good article on the matter: http://lua-users.org/wiki/CoroutinesAsEventHandlers
